# Movie Trailer Website

A simple movie trailer website project for Udacity's full-stack nanodegree program. The project demonstrates the use of a Movies class in Python to generate a static webpage, which displays a listing of favorite movies and links each movie to its YouTube trailer.

The project uses TMDB APIs to populate the attributes for the Movie class like image URL and YouTube trailer link.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
The project uses the python wrapper [TMDBSimple](https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple) for the TMDB APIs.
To Install TMDBSimple, go to your python installation directory. From the command line, run 

`pip install tmdbsimple`

Refer [TMDBSimple Installation](https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple#installation) for more information.
